# Image-Search

Simple script to locally store the top response from Google reverse image search

### Usage
1. Navigate to your prefered project directory in a terminal
2. `git clone https://github.com/jake-g/Image-Search.git`
3. `cd Image-Search` to enter this project directory
4. Verify you are using `Python 2.7.X` with the command `which python` (linux osx, not sure with windows)
5. Run the script, `python img_search.py`
6. When prompted, enter a valid image url (in chrome right click > open image in new tab > copy link in address bar and paste into program)
7. The script should start saving similar pictures into the project directory

This hasn't been tested on other computers or with many different pictures, so expect bugs and report them as issues.

Also notice the `# TODO` tags in the code which are aspect that I need to look into more
